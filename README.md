# Emotional-AI-predictions-using-ResNet
•Built a deep learning model based on CNN and ResNet50 using Keras with Tensorflow 2.0 as a backend to detect 15 facial key-points from facial data.

•Performed data augmentation to improve model generalization capability and improved network performance using regularization techniques such as   dropout. This project could be practically used for detecting customer emotions and facial expressions.
